1. Components of a DBMS (Database Management System)
A DBMS consists of several components that help in the storage, retrieval, and management of data. The key components are:
Hardware: The physical devices such as servers, storage devices, and network infrastructure where the database is stored and accessed.
Software: The DBMS software that enables users to create, manage, and interact with the database. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle DB.
Data: The actual information stored in the database, which can be structured in tables, rows, and columns.
Database Engine: The core service that processes database queries, executes operations, and manages data storage and retrieval.
Query Processor: Interprets and executes SQL queries, optimizing them for efficiency.
Transaction Management: Ensures ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties are maintained in transactions.
Security and Authorization Manager: Handles user authentication, permissions, and access control.
User Interface: Tools and interfaces such as SQL command-line tools or GUI-based interfaces for managing the database.
2. What is a Relational Database? Give 4 Examples.
A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into structured tables with rows and columns. It uses primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
Examples of relational databases:

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server
3. Classifications of SQL
SQL can be classified into three main categories:
Data Definition Language (DDL): Used for defining and managing database structures.
Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used to modify and query data in the database.
Data Control Language (DCL): Used for controlling access to the database.
4. Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key
Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row is unique and cannot be NULL.
Foreign Key: A field in one table that references the Primary Key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables.
5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the relationships between entities (tables) in a database. It helps in database design by illustrating how data is structured and related.

6. Advantages of Relational Databases
Data Integrity and Accuracy – Enforces constraints to ensure data consistency.
Flexibility – Data can be easily queried using SQL.
Scalability – Can handle large amounts of data efficiently.
Data Security – Provides role-based access control.
Avoids Data Redundancy – Uses normalization to eliminate duplicate data.
7. Four Types of Data Types Used in Tables
INTEGER (INT) – Stores whole numbers.
VARCHAR – Stores variable-length text.
DATE – Stores date values.
BOOLEAN – Stores TRUE or FALSE values.
8. Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)
A DBMS is used to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. Its purposes include:

Ensuring data security and integrity.
Allowing multi-user access to data.
Providing efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
Ensuring data consistency through ACID properties.
Supporting backup and recovery mechanisms.
